## What the difference between other protobuf libraries for Defold and this one?

This library comes with additional features like:
- Verification of the data to match the protocol buffer definition.
- Editor script to generate Lua annotations from proto files.
- Coverage with tests.
- Have a detailed documentation with examples.


## What is your experience with this library?

I use this library mostly for annotation generation and data verification. It helps me to keep the data consistent and avoid errors in the data structure.

Also annotations helps to write and inspect the code faster.
